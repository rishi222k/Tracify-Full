## A Blockchain Based Trusted Tracking system and Immunity Certificate Platform Accompanied with a Deflationary crypto token with built-in tokenomics ($VAX)

### The problem it solves:

In an effort to lift the social distancing measures, some countries including Chile, Germany, the UK and others have suggested the use of COVID-19 “immunity passports”  i.e. document that certify an individual has been infected and is immune to COVID19. The use of immunity licenses would create a restriction on who can and cannot participate in social and work-related activities and this would encourage forgery and incentivize people to seek infection. 
Herein, we build a blockchain technology to combat two challenges while using immunity certificates, falsification of information and people seeking out for COVID-19 infection

Contact tracing helps avoid the spread of a virus through pro-actively identifying, advising, and, where necessary, quarantining individuals who are at a higher risk than others. Using this tracing technique is useful, and smartphones aid in making the system more effective only if privacy and other issues are addressed. Governments and healthcare organizations engage in contact-tracing activities to monitor patients. However, using blockchain at every step increases the accuracy and reliability of data collected. Blockchain technology can monitor patient movements and offer updates related to affected areas in real time. Furthermore, it can be used to detect virus-free zones to inform the public about safe areas. 

### Inspiration: 

 There is no denying that blockchain technology is here to stay. We are firm believers that blockchain will disrupt not just the financial sector but all industries of the world, healthcare included. So when our team sat down to brainstorm ideas about how we can leverage blockchain for our project, it occurred to us – why not try to use this wonderful piece of tech to make something which will help with arguably one of the worst pandemics (not only by number of people affected but also economically) to ever plague humankind? That is how we came up with the idea for our project.
